## Getting Started

## Plans for Future Development

As of the writing of this readme, the application has a long ways to go in terms of implementing all the desired functionality, getting stuck on the fundamentals of logging in and handling the navigation consumed the majority of available development time. My intention is to continue working on this project until it functions as desired and ask for a small handful of users to test it out and provide feedback. As I have invested a massive amount of time on this challenge, I would like it to eventually be a featured application in my portfolio.
